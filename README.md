I made this app since I wanted to reduce food waste personally and promote cooking for myself. This app proves that whether you have a little or a lot in your pantry, you can always manage to cook something.

Using the Pantry web app, users can track their grocery items in a virtual pantry. Pantry is divided into pantry items.
Users can post pantry items and their names, and descriptions.
